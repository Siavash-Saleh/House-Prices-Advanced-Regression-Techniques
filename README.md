# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques
This project focuses on predicting house prices using the Kaggle Housing dataset and Lasso Regression. It includes a complete pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Steps Taken:

1- Data Loading & Exploration
Imported the dataset and explored key features and checked for missing values

2- Data Cleaning: 
Handled missing data using imputation strategies. Dropped or filled irrelevant or sparse columns

3-Feature Engineering: 
Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding. Combined and transformed features to improve model learning

4-Feature Scaling: 
Standardized numerical features for better model performance

5- Model Selection: 
Used Lasso Regression for its regularization power

6- Model Evaluation
Evaluated performance using RMSE on the test data. Analyzed model accuracy and important features



Notation:

This project is based on the Housing dataset, commonly used for advanced regression tasks in Kaggle competitions.
